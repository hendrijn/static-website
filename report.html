          The website is for WIT club to create a central location to look at
          information for members.
        </li>
        <li>
          All text is my own, with images provided by open licence google
          searches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Home, Exec, Events, Fundraisers, Contact Us. Home is the .index file.
        </li>
        <li>The header contains the WIT logo and the navigation tabs.</li>
        <li>The nav links are placed in the header and link to each file.</li>
        <li>
          I used media queries to change the font size for header/footer, adjust
          the events and fundraisers page to be monocolumn, and create the
          hamburger menu when viewing on mobile screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          I created a main.css file which houses all formatting for the header
          and footer. Since events and fundraising had the same styling, I
          created a joint css file for those too. All other page styling was in
          a separate file.
        </li>
        <li>
          All images have an alt attribute that matches the content of the
          image.
        </li>
        <li>
          The favicon for each page is a smaller version of a WIT logo that
          appears in the tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          All images are in the images folder, all css files are in a css
          folder, and all js files are in a js folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only html, css, and javascript were used in the development in the
          site.
        </li>
        <li>
          I ran each page through the Nu Validator site and all got the green
          result.
        </li>
        <li>
          The home page uses a two column layout that justifies the paragraph of
          text on the left. Other pages do use center alignment, things like the
          tiles for events and fundraisers are left aligned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Text never goes to the edge of the screen. All paragraphs, headings,
          and lists have spacing between them so nothing is smushed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Headings are all Fredoka One and the body is Lato. Both fonts are from
          Google Fonts.
        </li>
        <li>!!!Form!!!</li>
        <li>
          Links to the social media pages and email address link to external
          websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          All class and id names are in camel case and all lowercase. ID's are
          present once in a file while classes appear multiple times.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hamburger menu turns to an X when clicked, the exec images blur
          when hovered, the join now button appears to come forward, and the nav
          menu items move from the right side when the burger menu is opened.
          Are powered by CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
          The site is stored in a Git repository named static-website under the
          username hendrijn. I dm'd Chris on Slack with the link.
        </li>
        <li>
          The filenames don't have any uppercase or non-alphanumeric characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          My site is available at both https and http
          project1.jacquelyn-hendricks.me
        </li>
        <li>
          I used a Let's Encrypt certificate to serve the site out over HTTPS on
          port 443.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a user goes to http on port 80, they are redirected to port 443.
        </li>
        <li>My repository shows frequent commits after each work session.</li>
